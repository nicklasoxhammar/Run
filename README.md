# Run
Simple running app.

The app is meant to show the users position on google maps, the speed they are travelling at and the duration of their run.
The user should be able to save their "runs" and see how far they ran, how fast, where, when, etc.

It should be very simple to use, i'm thinking it should only have two or three activites, one that shows the map, speed, startbutton etc and another
activity that shows a list of previous "runs", maybe a settings activity or an activity that shows more detail about previous runs.
